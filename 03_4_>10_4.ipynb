        "This week I spent most of my time on Li et al's *Practical Approaches to Causal Relationship Exploration*. I found this book remarkably helpful, especially its coverage of the PC family; I passed over the sections on statistically based methods in comparison. Also of note were the explanations of the Causal Markov and faithfulness conditions in this book, giving unique interpretations I required assistance to interpret.\n",

        "Of particular interest in Kalainathan's CDT package was the Structural Agnostic Model developed by himself and others. I read the white paper for the algorithm and parts of Sch√∂lkopf et al's *Elements of Causal Inference: Foundations and Learning Algorithms* to boost my understanding."
