# Hi! This repository is a log of my activity in SCIE3250 (Introduction to Research in Physics) throughout Semester One 2020 at the University of Queensland. Following a broad introduction to the modern practice of machine learning and causal inference, I explored different research directions before settling on a causal analysis of a subset of the MIMIC-3 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) ICU database compiled by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
