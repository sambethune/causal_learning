        "This week I began reading into causal inference, temporarily leaving behind applied machine learning. Having been recommended Schölkopf and Janzing's lectures from the 2013 Tübingen conference, I began studying these but found them beyond my grasp. For now, a simpler resource was called for.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following some stumbling, including watching part of Jonas Peters' excellent lectures while reading along with their associated script (again out of my reach eventually), I arrived at a an approachable introductory lecture assuming no background. This was Pearl's presentation on causal reasoning at PyData LA 2018.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next I investigated Pearl et al's *Causal Inference in Statistics: a Primer*. This was almost ideal; concepts were clearly defined and very little assumed by way of prior knowledge."
