        "Reading Pearl et al's *Primer* from cover to cover took me well into this week. Given the grounding in constraint based methods and SCM's this allowed for however, I consider it to have been time well spent. Little was discussed with regards to causal discovery algorithms with the exception of a basic outline of the (broad) PC algorithm family.\n",

        "Upon finishing the book, I also revisited Peters' notes and finished them. Just prior to the end of the week, I read over Kalainathan's white paper on CDT and recognised the need to further my knowledge of causal discovery algorithms."
